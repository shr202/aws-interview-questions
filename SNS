AWS SNS:::
AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service that allows applications, microservices, 
and users to send and receive notifications.

🔹 Key Features of AWS SNS
✅ Pub/Sub Messaging Model → Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive them.
✅ Supports Multiple Protocols → Send messages via Email, SMS, HTTP(S), Lambda, SQS, and 
Mobile Push Notifications (FCM, APNs, etc.).
✅ Highly Scalable & Reliable → Handles millions of messages per second.
✅ Message Filtering → Subscribers can filter messages based on attributes.
✅ Event-Driven Architecture → Works with AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, and other AWS services.

🔹 How AWS SNS Works
1️⃣ Create an SNS Topic (e.g., order-updates)
2️⃣ Subscribe to the Topic (Email, SMS, SQS, Lambda, etc.)
3️⃣ Publish Messages to the Topic (from AWS SDK, CLI, or Console)
4️⃣ SNS Delivers Messages to Subscribers

🔹 Example Use Case:

An e-commerce app sends order status updates to customers via SMS or email.

A serverless app triggers AWS Lambda functions on new SNS messages.

CloudWatch alarms use SNS to send alerts about system failures.
